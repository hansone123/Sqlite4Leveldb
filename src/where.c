** The query generator uses an array of instances of this structure to
** help it analyze the subexpressions of the WHERE clause.  Each WHERE
** clause subexpression is separated from the others by AND operators,
** usually, or sometimes subexpressions separated by OR.
**
** All WhereTerms are collected into a single WhereClause structure.  
** The following identity holds:
**
**        WhereTerm.pWC->a[WhereTerm.idx] == WhereTerm
**
** When a term is of the form:
**
**              X <op> <expr>
**
** where X is a column name and <op> is one of certain operators,
** then WhereTerm.leftCursor and WhereTerm.u.leftColumn record the
** cursor number and column number for X.  WhereTerm.eOperator records
** the <op> using a bitmask encoding defined by WO_xxx below.  The
** use of a bitmask encoding for the operator allows us to search
** quickly for terms that match any of several different operators.
**
** A WhereTerm might also be two or more subterms connected by OR:
**
**         (t1.X <op> <expr>) OR (t1.Y <op> <expr>) OR ....
**
** In this second case, wtFlag as the TERM_ORINFO set and eOperator==WO_OR
** and the WhereTerm.u.pOrInfo field points to auxiliary information that
** is collected about the
**
** If a term in the WHERE clause does not match either of the two previous
** categories, then eOperator==0.  The WhereTerm.pExpr field is still set
** to the original subexpression content and wtFlags is set up appropriately
** but no other fields in the WhereTerm object are meaningful.
**
** When eOperator!=0, prereqRight and prereqAll record sets of cursor numbers,
** but they do so indirectly.  A single WhereMaskSet structure translates
** cursor number into bits and the translated bit is stored in the prereq
** fields.  The translation is used in order to maximize the number of
** bits that will fit in a Bitmask.  The VDBE cursor numbers might be
** spread out over the non-negative integers.  For example, the cursor
** numbers might be 3, 8, 9, 10, 20, 23, 41, and 45.  The WhereMaskSet
** translates these sparse cursor numbers into consecutive integers
** beginning with 0 in order to make the best possible use of the available
** bits in the Bitmask.  So, in the example above, the cursor numbers
** would be mapped into integers 0 through 7.
**
** The number of terms in a join is limited by the number of bits
** in prereqRight and prereqAll.  The default is 64 bits, hence SQLite
** is only able to process joins with 64 or fewer tables.

** 57->5, 73->4.  Or one of 719 other combinations might be used. It

** Analyze a term that consists of two or more OR-connected

**     ... WHERE  (a=5) AND (b=7 OR c=9 OR d=13) AND (d=13)
**                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**
** This routine analyzes terms such as the middle term in the above example.
** A WhereOrTerm object is computed and attached to the term under
** analysis, regardless of the outcome of the analysis.  Hence:
**
**     WhereTerm.wtFlags   |=  TERM_ORINFO
**     WhereTerm.u.pOrInfo  =  a dynamically allocated WhereOrTerm object
**
** The term being analyzed must have two or more of OR-connected subterms.
** A single subterm might be a set of AND-connected sub-subterms.
** Examples of terms under analysis:
**
**     (A)     t1.x=t2.y OR t1.x=t2.z OR t1.y=15 OR t1.z=t3.a+5
**     (B)     x=expr1 OR expr2=x OR x=expr3
**     (C)     t1.x=t2.y OR (t1.x=t2.z AND t1.y=15)
**     (D)     x=expr1 OR (y>11 AND y<22 AND z LIKE '*hello*')
**     (E)     (p.a=1 AND q.b=2 AND r.c=3) OR (p.x=4 AND q.y=5 AND r.z=6)
**
** CASE 1:
**
** If all subterms are of the form T.C=expr for some single column of C and
** a single table T (as shown in example B above) then create a new virtual
** term that is an equivalent IN expression.  In other words, if the term
** being analyzed is:
**
**      x = expr1  OR  expr2 = x  OR  x = expr3
**
** then create a new virtual term like this:
**
**      x IN (expr1,expr2,expr3)
**
** CASE 2:
**
** If all subterms are indexable by a single table T, then set
**
**     WhereTerm.eOperator              =  WO_OR
**     WhereTerm.u.pOrInfo->indexable  |=  the cursor number for table T
**
** A subterm is "indexable" if it is of the form
** "T.C <op> <expr>" where C is any column of table T and 
** <op> is one of "=", "<", "<=", ">", ">=", "IS NULL", or "IN".
** A subterm is also indexable if it is an AND of two or more
** subsubterms at least one of which is indexable.  Indexable AND 
** subterms have their eOperator set to WO_AND and they have
** u.pAndInfo set to a dynamically allocated WhereAndTerm object.
**
** From another point of view, "indexable" means that the subterm could
** potentially be used with an index if an appropriate index exists.
** This analysis does not consider whether or not the index exists; that
** is something the bestIndex() routine will determine.  This analysis
** only looks at whether subterms appropriate for indexing exist.
**
** All examples A through E above all satisfy case 2.  But if a term
** also statisfies case 1 (such as B) we know that the optimizer will
** always prefer case 1, so in that case we pretend that case 2 is not
** satisfied.
**
** It might be the case that multiple tables are indexable.  For example,
** (E) above is indexable on tables P, Q, and R.
**
** Terms that satisfy case 2 are candidates for lookup by using
** separate indices to find rowids for each subterm and composing
** the union of all rowids using a RowSet object.  This is similar
** to "bitmap indices" in other database engines.
**
** OTHERWISE:
**
** If neither case 1 nor case 2 apply, then leave the eOperator set to
** zero.  This term is not useful for search.

** This function is used to estimate the number of rows that will be visited

** bound, a lower bound, or both. The WHERE clause terms that set the upper
** and lower bounds are represented by pLower and pUpper respectively. For
** example, assuming that index p is on t1(a):
**
**   ... FROM t1 WHERE a > ? AND a < ? ...
**                    |_____|   |_____|

**                     pLower    pUpper
**
** If either of the upper or lower bound is not present, then NULL is passed in
** place of the corresponding WhereTerm.
**
** The nEq parameter is passed the index of the index column subject to the
** range constraint. Or, equivalently, the number of equality constraints
** optimized by the proposed index scan. For example, assuming index p is
** on t1(a, b), and the SQL query is:
**
**   ... FROM t1 WHERE a = ? AND b > ? AND b < ? ...
**
** then nEq should be passed the value 1 (as the range restricted column,
** b, is the second left-most column of the index). Or, if the query is:
**
**   ... FROM t1 WHERE a > ? AND a < ? ...
**
** then nEq should be passed 0.
**

/*
** Generate the beginning of the loop used for WHERE clause processing.
** The return value is a pointer to an opaque structure that contains
** information needed to terminate the loop.  Later, the calling routine
** should invoke sqlite4WhereEnd() with the return value of this function
** in order to complete the WHERE clause processing.
**
** If an error occurs, this routine returns NULL.
**
** The basic idea is to do a nested loop, one loop for each table in
** the FROM clause of a select.  (INSERT and UPDATE statements are the
** same as a SELECT with only a single table in the FROM clause.)  For
** example, if the SQL is this:
**
**       SELECT * FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE ...;
**
** Then the code generated is conceptually like the following:
**
**      foreach row1 in t1 do       \    Code generated
**        foreach row2 in t2 do      |-- by sqlite4WhereBegin()
**          foreach row3 in t3 do   /
**            ...
**          end                     \    Code generated
**        end                        |-- by sqlite4WhereEnd()
**      end                         /
**
** Note that the loops might not be nested in the order in which they
** appear in the FROM clause if a different order is better able to make
** use of indices.  Note also that when the IN operator appears in
** the WHERE clause, it might result in additional nested loops for
** scanning through all values on the right-hand side of the IN.
**
** There are Btree cursors associated with each table.  t1 uses cursor
** number pTabList->a[0].iCursor.  t2 uses the cursor pTabList->a[1].iCursor.
** And so forth.  This routine generates code to open those VDBE cursors
** and sqlite4WhereEnd() generates the code to close them.
**
** The code that sqlite4WhereBegin() generates leaves the cursors named
** in pTabList pointing at their appropriate entries.  The [...] code
** can use OP_Column and OP_Rowid opcodes on these cursors to extract
** data from the various tables of the loop.
**
** If the WHERE clause is empty, the foreach loops must each scan their
** entire tables.  Thus a three-way join is an O(N^3) operation.  But if
** the tables have indices and there are terms in the WHERE clause that
** refer to those indices, a complete table scan can be avoided and the
** code will run much faster.  Most of the work of this routine is checking
** to see if there are indices that can be used to speed up the loop.
**
** Terms of the WHERE clause are also used to limit which rows actually
** make it to the "..." in the middle of the loop.  After each "foreach",
** terms of the WHERE clause that use only terms in that loop and outer
** loops are evaluated and if false a jump is made around all subsequent
** inner loops (or around the "..." if the test occurs within the inner-
** most loop)
**
** OUTER JOINS
**
** An outer join of tables t1 and t2 is conceptally coded as follows:
**
**    foreach row1 in t1 do
**      flag = 0
**      foreach row2 in t2 do
**        start:
**          ...
**          flag = 1
**      end
**      if flag==0 then
**        move the row2 cursor to a null row
**        goto start
**      fi
**    end
**
** ORDER BY CLAUSE PROCESSING
**
** pOrderBy is a pointer to the ORDER BY clause (or the GROUP BY clause
** if the WHERE_GROUPBY flag is set in wctrlFlags) of a SELECT statement
** if there is one.  If there is no ORDER BY clause or if this routine
** is called from an UPDATE or DELETE statement, then pOrderBy is NULL.
